    The way to model the directed graph is the following:
    Given any clause, determine the relation of implication between the two
    variables considering we want the clause to be true.
    Eg: (1,2) then !x1 => x2 and !x2 => x1

    In other words, the list of constraints is transformed into a list of
    implications between variables. We build the directed graph based on these
    implications, compute SSCs. If any SCC contains both a variable and it's
    negation than the clauses are un-satisfiable.
