# All pairs shortest path algorithm

# In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs shortest-path problem.
# Here are data files describing three graphs:

# The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. 
# Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) 
# and its length (the third number). 
# NOTE: some of the edge lengths are negative. 
# NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.

# Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you must first identify which, 
# if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. For each such graph, you should compute 
# all-pairs shortest paths and remember the smallest one 
# (i.e., compute minu,vExistVd(u,v), where d(u,v) denotes the shortest-path distance from u to v).

# If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the box below. 
# If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest shortest 
# path in the box below. If two or more of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the 
# smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.

# OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. If you have extra time, 
# try comparing the performance of different all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!
